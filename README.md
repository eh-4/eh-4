Hi! My name is Oscar Emerson Ham and I am a robotics engineer and successful entrepreneur 
who is looking for employment in robotics and automation, applicable to many industries. 
I am experienced in the development of intelligent systems including artificial 
intelligence, advanced computer vision, kinematics, and mechanical design.

The public part of this repository contains a few samples of my work to date. I am in the 
process of adding my previous work to this public repository so feel free to ask about my 
other work and I'll be glad to prioritize adding those for you to see!

Here's a quick look at my acheivements over the last few years:
 - 2016-2021 Concurently to my education, I started up Good Racks LLC, a company leveraging 
   automation to manufacture goods for the ski industry. Despite being completely robbed and
   losing all our employees and location at the start of the pandemic, I've spent the last 
   year rebuilding the company and we've now employed 17 people to date, the company is self 
   sufficient without my help now, and is reliably profitable.
 - 2018-2020 Masters in Robotics & Automation, Colorado School of Mines, GPA: 3.63
 - 2017-2018 Helped start a new biomedical engineering lab at Virginia Tech, developing 
   Ultrasonic Histotripsy, the use of high amplitude ultrasonic cavitation to 
   non-invasivaly destroy cancerous tumors and other related medical issues.
 - 2013-2017 Bachelors in Engineering Science and Mechanics(Better Described as Engineering 
   Mechanics with a heavy focus towards math and programming), Virginia Tech
